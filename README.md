# Motivation

Rather than buying physical cookbooks, many aspiring cooks and bakers are turing to websites such as Pinterest and food.com for recipes to try. The purpose of this project is to answer the following questions:

  1. Are the distribution of ratings for recipes based on their category consistent?
  2. Overtime, does the prevalence for certain 'health' foods increase? 
  3.
