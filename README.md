# Motivation

Rather than buying physical cookbooks, many aspiring cooks and bakers are turing to websites such as Pinterest and food.com for recipes to try. Similar to many patrons and researchers, I am attracted to recipes with high ratings and trendy or health conscious ingredients. However, how reliable are the ratings from the general population? I sought to look into answering the following questions: 

  1. Are the distribution of ratings for recipes based on their category consistent?
  2. Overtime, does the prevalence for certain 'health' foods increase? 
  3.

Each category has a similar distribution with a mean between 4.6 and 4.7 stars and a median of 5.0. This indicates that the category of recipe has little impact on how it is rated. The highly skewed distributions also indicate that the recipe ratings have little meaning as half of rated recipes have a rating of 5 stars. While it might be difficult to discern the best recipes based on their rating, less favorable recipes are easily identified with ratings of 4 or below since 4.5 and 5 stars appear to be cheap.
